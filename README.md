# Welcome to aiBook repo

The project is [deployed on Vercel](https://ai-book-kappa.vercel.app/)

Just create an account and start creating stories or read from what's already been generated!

To run the project locally, first install dependencies and start the server:

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm run dev
```

Have fun!
